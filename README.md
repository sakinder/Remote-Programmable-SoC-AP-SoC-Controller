# Remote-Programmable-SoC-AP-SoC-Controller(RAPSOCC)
When working with an Ethernet communication interface, a TCP/IP stack is mostly used to communicate over a local or a wide area network.
It is important to understand the functionality, configuration, and usage of this RAPSOCC, and to decide whether it is sufficient for his or her research use.
RAPSOCC is in continued, active development in slow progress.
While normal for many open source projects, RAPSOCC is quite heavy on the hardware side, and is therefore somewhat of a time sink in free time.
